# DnD Voice Dice Roller

A Voice-Controlled App to roll role-playing dice.

Built with [Speechly](https://github.com/speechly/browser-client)

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev # running in http://localhost:5000
```

## Production build

To create an optimised version of the app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can run the newly built app with `npm run start`. This uses [sirv](https://github.com/lukeed/sirv), which is included in your package.json's `dependencies` so that the app will work when you deploy to platforms like [Heroku](https://heroku.com).

## Deploying to the web

Install `now` if you haven't already:

```bash
npm install -g now
```

Then, from within your project folder:

```bash

```

As an alternative, use the [Now desktop client](https://zeit.co/download) and simply drag the unzipped project folder to the taskbar icon.
